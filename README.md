# Face-Recognition
This is a Face Recogniton system made using Haar-Cascade Classifiers.   


This project consistes of three files:  
->The image_capture_interface.py lets you take 100 pics of yourself and adds the images to the images folder.    
->The face_trainer.py builds a .yml files with the data provided.    
->The face_recognition.py is the main file which uses the face_trainer to recognise faces from the camera feed.     



There is a folder named Images which contains photos of 30 random people which will help to train the classifier. The images taken using image_capture_interface.py are stored here.  

First run the image_capture_interface.py file, then face_trainer.py and then in the end face_recognition.py for perfect results.
